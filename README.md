 Application Description:

 Yeah, so, I got more things working than I had working last Sunday, but it's still pretty rough.

 Authentication and Account Creation are fully functioning.  If you are not logged in to the appliation, you should only see two links, 'home' and 'browse.' Once you create an account or login you 
 should see your name appear underneath the 'logout' button.  Also, once you are logged in, you should see the 'login' button change to read 'logout'. Also changing once logged in, you should also see two new links appear: 'create recipe' and 'your recipes.'

 To create a recipe, you must click on the 'create recipe' link and complete the form. At the bottom of the form is a 'create recipe' button. Once you click the 'create recipe' button you will need to click on
 'your recipes' and the 'load recipes' button. Once you
 click on 'load recipes' it should push in your newly created recipe.  You can continue to go back to the 
 'create account' form and add additional recipes, that
 should store in the account.

 For each individual recipe that you create and that
 shows on your 'your-recipes' page, you can click the
 the 'view' button to view the full-recipe page.  I was
 not able to get the information to push in the new
 recipe information into the form.

 I was also not able to get the delete button working.
